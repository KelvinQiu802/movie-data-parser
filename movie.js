Liu Jianming gradually wanted to become a real good person, while Chen Yongren hoped to return to the status of a policeman as soon as possible. The serious crime team learned a batch of drug dealing intelligence from Chen Yongren, and focused on the target person, Han Chen. Unexpectedly, the intelligence was leaked by Liu Jianming, and the actions of both parties failed. However, this incident exposed the fact that both parties were undercover, and triggered the determination of the high-level officials of both parties to eliminate the ghosts.

      "Francesca (played by Meryl Streep)'s children look through their mother's old letters and reveal a touching relationship that their mother didn't know before her death. One day in 1965, Francesca was alone at home, and the last cowboy-photographer Robert Kincaid (Clint Eastwood) stopped the car at her door and asked her where the Mandison Bridge was. She took him to the bridge, and he gave her a bunch of wild chrysanthemums to express his gratitude after finishing the work. There was an indescribable feeling in her heart. She stapled a note to the bridge, inviting him to dinner. He who came happily had a wonderful evening with her. The two stayed together all day for the next two days. But Francesca couldn't let go of her children and worldly happiness, so Robert finally set out on the road alone. A few days later, the two had a brief glimpse at the entrance of the supermarket. At that time, Francesca resisted the urge to run forward, and the rain became their farewell tears. In March 1982, she learned of Robert's death. On the last journey of her life, she made a will: she asked her children to scatter their ashes by the Madison Bridge. During her lifetime, she left all her time to her family, but she hoped that she could always be by her lover's side after death.",

Director Richard Linklater and the two leading actors are like going on a 9-year date with movie fans. Although the production span of the trilogy is as long as 18 years, the storyline can almost be written on the back of a piece of paper. Movies are used to telling stories only through conversations between people. The two protagonists are either walking in the quiet village, or sitting leisurely on the terrace or at the dining table, constantly discussing topics such as literature, love, life, and gender. Unlike the first two films, however, as they finally get together, the romance of love begins to be replaced by the everyday trivialities of life and the practicality of being with each other, and fights and bickering ensue. How to maintain love under the veil of "marriage"? The movie spreads out 18 years of feelings, and then gradually resolves those little resentments, presenting the most real and moving side of love.',

It wasn't until the appearance of the black Dexis Driss (played by Omar Sy) that he made a decision. Dexis had just come out of prison and was burdened by his family. He only wanted to find a letter of dismissal to apply for relief money, and he was obviously more interested in female assistants than this job. But Philip still caught the young man with a glance. So Dexis started a one-month trial period. Although the comfortable mansion environment made him feel vain, he still faced many challenges: not only did he have to rehabilitate Philip, but he also had to bathe him, enema, open letters, and put on stockings. At first, their way of thinking and values ​​were quite different, but as they got to know each other better, they became friends... Cruce and Omar Sai share the best actor crown.",

German businessman Oscar Schindler (played by Liam Neeson) came to Krakow under German rule and opened an enamel factory to produce military supplies. With outstanding social skills and a lot of money, Schindler established a good relationship with the German army. His factory hired Jews to work and made a lot of war fortune. In 1943, the Jews in Krakow suffered a tragic massacre. Schindler was greatly shocked when he witnessed all this. He bribed the officers and made his factory a labor camp attached to the concentration camp. Here, his factory also became a sanctuary for the Jews. In 1944, on the eve of Germany's defeat, the massacre of Jews became more and more frenzied. Schindler issued a list of 1,200 people to the German military officers, and bought the lives of these Jews with all his wealth. In those dark days, to save one person is to save the whole world.",

Since his favorite "Anarchy" was pre-empted by another teacher, he could only speak "Dictatorship" courses. For the free-spirited students, any course is just for credits. They chatted loudly in class and didn\'t pay attention to the lecture. Wen Geer ingeniously proposed a hypothetical "dictatorship" experiment. During the one-week experiment, Wen GeEr was placed in the supreme position, and the students had to obey him absolutely. From the initial playful mentality, these young men and women gradually indulged in this organization called "The Wave". They realized the importance of collective and discipline, but unknowingly slipped into the abyss of "dictatorship" and "Nazi"... ... The film was adapted from real events and won the 2008 German Film Outstanding Feature Film and Best Supporting Actor Award (Frederick Lau).',

Annika Wade Cop (Annika Wedderkopp) is a precocious girl who is particularly close to Lucas. Faced with the girl's childish and simple overtures, Lucas could only politely refuse, but what he didn't expect was that this move pushed his life to the cusp of the storm. Carla's retaliatory lies charged Lucas with the crime of sexually assaulting a girl. For a while, this good man became the object of exclusion and oppression by the whole town. Friend's anger, ex-wife's mistrust, pet dog's death and stranger's viciousness nearly collapsed Lucas, but when the little Kara told the truth, the maliciousness did not disappear along with Lucas's innocence.

The most expensive documentary in history. What is the ocean? This movie tells you the answer. This is a refreshing and breathtaking ecology documentary with the theme of environmental protection. The film focuses on the "blue territory" that covers three-quarters of the Earth\'s surface. The director deeply explores this deep and rich mysterious world, and fully presents the magnificent vastness of the ocean. The adventures in the real animal world are far more exciting than the stories in the cartoons, and then the screen unfolds—a huge group of jellyfish, right whales, great white sharks, penguins, etc. Showing their exuberant vitality without hesitation in front of the camera is amazing.',

      'In 1986 in Dallas, USA, the homophobic Texas electrician Ron Woodruff (Matthew McConaughey played by Matthew McConaughey) found himself suffering from "gay disease"-AIDS, with only 30 days left to live. The AZT (azidethymidine) he used was the only anti-AIDS drug approved by the FDA at that time, but it was extremely toxic. In order to survive, RON began researching various anti-aids prescriptions and alternative therapies, and even smuggled unapproved drugs from around the world. With the help of doctor Sachs (Jennifer Garner) and transvestite Raymond (Jared Leto), Ron began to form an underground organization called the "Dallas Buyers Club" to fight against AIDS. People provide more "unconventional therapy", and many sick gay men also turn to him. His move was naturally obstructed and pressured by the Drug Administration and drug companies. Ron finally died in September 1992, 2,557 days after he was told he had only 30 days to live. In the past seven years, he has relentlessly fought hard against the disease, the Drug Administration and drug manufacturers, and enjoyed the life he really lived... The story of how the patient struggled to survive and save thousands of others facing the same situation, was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor/Actor in a Drama Series and won 29 awards.',

"The migration of birds is a story about promise, a promise of return." Jacques Perhan took us on a journey of birds and dream flight with these words. Undoubtedly, [Migrating Birds] directly defined the standard of the world\'s top documentary "acquisition of reality" - a total of more than 600 people participated in the filming, which lasted more than 3 years and cost more than 40 million US dollars, with scenes in more than 50 countries around the world and regions, the recording film is more than 460 kilometers long. This movie, which used 17 of the world\'s best pilots and two scientific expedition teams, caused a sensation as soon as it came out. In just three weeks, more than 2.5 million French people went to theaters for it. Whooper swans who flew over 1,200 kilometers persisted in their lives, sandhill cranes sought their way out in the wind and sand, and penguins fought against sea crows to the end in the snow and ice... ...Although there are failures and discouragement, there are also wooden brains on the edge of the cliff, and there are also peeps from human greed. Except for simple explanations, there are no more words in the whole film. The protagonist of this film is a naive bird with different shapes. They took us to fly over the sea, the snow field, and the mountains; they used their vibrating wings to explain flying, persistence, warmth, and life to us.',
